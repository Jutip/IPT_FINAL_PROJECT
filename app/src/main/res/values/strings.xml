        Chicken Adobo is arguably the most iconic and beloved Filipino dish. It involves chicken pieces braised in a savory, tangy, and slightly sweet sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 2 lbs chicken, cut into serving pieces (thighs and legs are great)<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup soy sauce<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup white vinegar<br/>
        &#8226; 1 whole head of garlic, cloves crushed<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon whole peppercorns, lightly crushed<br/>
        &#8226; 2-3 dried bay leaves<br/>
        &#8226; 1 tablespoon cooking oil (for searing)<br/>
        &#8226; 1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional, for a sweeter adobo)<br/>
        &#8226; 1 cup water or broth<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Marinate:</b> In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, soy sauce, vinegar, crushed garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Mix well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the fridge for best results).<br/>
        2.  <b>Sear:</b> Separate the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade liquid. Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken pieces in batches until browned on all sides. Remove chicken and set aside.<br/>
        3.  <b>Simmer:</b> Pour the reserved marinade and the water/broth into the same pot. Bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits from the bottom.<br/>
        4.  <b>Braise:</b> Return the seared chicken to the pot. Add the brown sugar (if using). Lower the heat, cover, and let it simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.<br/>
        5.  <b>Reduce Sauce (Optional):</b> If you prefer a thicker sauce, remove the lid for the last 10 minutes of cooking and let the sauce reduce and thicken.<br/>
        6.  <b>Serve:</b> Remove the bay leaves. Serve hot with steamed rice, spooning the extra sauce over the top.

        Chicken Inasal is a famous grilled chicken dish from Bacolod, Philippines. It\'s known for its unique, savory, and slightly tangy flavor from a marinade of lemongrass, calamansi, ginger, and annatto (atsuete).

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients (for Marinade):</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 4-6 chicken leg quarters (thigh and drumstick)<br/>
        &#8226; 3 stalks lemongrass, white parts only, pounded and chopped<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup calamansi juice (or lemon/lime juice)<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup sukang tuba (coconut vinegar) or white vinegar<br/>
        &#8226; 2 tablespoons ginger, grated<br/>
        &#8226; 6 cloves garlic, minced<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup soy sauce or patis (fish sauce)<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients (for Basting Oil):</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup margarine or butter<br/>
        &#8226; 2 tablespoons annatto (atsuete) seeds<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon minced garlic (optional)<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Marinate:</b> In a large bowl, combine all marinade ingredients. Add the chicken pieces and rub the marinade all over. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.<br/>
        2.  <b>Prepare Basting Oil:</b> In a small saucepan, heat the margarine and annatto seeds over low heat. Do not let it boil. Stir until the oil turns deep orange/red (about 5-10 minutes). Strain the oil into a bowl and discard the seeds. Add minced garlic if using.<br/>
        3.  <b>Skewer:</b> Traditionally, the chicken is skewered on bamboo sticks. This is optional but helpful for grilling.<br/>
        4.  <b>Grill:</b> Preheat a charcoal grill (preferred) or a grill pan over medium heat. Remove chicken from the marinade (discard marinade).<br/>
        5.  Grill the chicken for 10-15 minutes per side, or until cooked through and charred in spots. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).<br/>
        6.  <b>Baste:</b> While grilling, generously baste the chicken with the annatto oil on both sides. This gives it the classic Inasal color and flavor.<br/>
        7.  <b>Serve:</b> Serve hot with steamed rice, soy sauce-calamansi-chili dipping sauce, and extra annatto oil for drizzling over the rice.

        <![CDATA[
        Lechon Kawali is a popular Filipino dish consisting of pork belly deep-fried in a wok or pot. The result is a delightfully crispy skin and juicy, tender meat. It\'s often served with a lechon sauce or a soy-vinegar dip.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 2 lbs pork belly (liempo), whole slab<br/>
        &#8226; 4 cups water<br/>
        &#8226; 1 tablespoon salt<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon whole peppercorns<br/>
        &#8226; 3 bay leaves<br/>
        &#8226; 4-6 cups cooking oil (for deep frying)<br/>
        &#8226; Salt (for rubbing)<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Boil:</b> In a large pot, combine the pork belly, water, 1 tbsp salt, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 30-45 minutes, or until the pork is tender.
        2.  <b>Dry:</b> Remove the pork from the pot and let it cool. Pat it completely dry with paper towels. A very dry surface is key to crispy skin.<br/>
        3.  <b>Score and Salt:</b> Rub the skin generously with salt. You can also prick the skin with a fork (but this may cause more oil splatter).
        4.  <b>Air Dry/Chill:</b> For best results, let the pork slab air dry in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or overnight. This makes the skin extra crispy.<br/>
        5.  <b>Deep Fry:</b> Heat the cooking oil in a deep pot or wok to 350°F (175°C). The oil should be enough to submerge the pork.
        6.  <b>WARNING:</b> Carefully lower the dry pork belly into the hot oil, skin-side down. **Use a splatter guard or the pot lid, as the oil will splatter violently.**<br/>
        7.  Fry for 20-30 minutes, turning occasionally, until the pork is golden brown and the skin is extremely crispy and blistered (puffed up).<br/>
        8.  <b>Drain:</b> Remove the pork from the oil and let it drain on a wire rack.
        9.  <b>Serve:</b> Let it rest for 10 minutes before chopping into cubes. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.

        &#8226; 4 cloves garlic, minced<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup annatto (atsuete) seeds, soaked in 1 cup hot water (or 2 tbsp annatto powder)<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup toasted ground rice (or rice flour, toasted in a dry pan)<br/>
        &#8226; 1 cup unsweetened peanut butter<br/>

        2.  <b>Prepare Annatto:</b> Strain the annatto-soaked water into a bowl, discarding the seeds. This is your coloring.<br/>
        3.  <b>Saut&#233;:</b> In a large pot or wok, saut&#233; garlic and onions. Add the tenderized oxtail and tripe.
        4.  <b>Make the Sauce:</b> Pour in the annatto water and 2-3 cups of the reserved beef broth. Bring to a simmer.<br/>

        7.  <b>Cook Vegetables:</b> Add the sitaw, eggplant, and banana heart. Simmer for 5-7 minutes. Add the pechay and cook for 1-2 minutes more, until all vegetables are tender-crisp.<br/>
        8.  <b>Season:</b> Season with salt and pepper. (The sauce should be mild, as the saltiness comes from the bagoong).

        Inihaw na Isda (Grilled Fish) is a simple, classic Filipino dish. A whole fish is typically stuffed with tomatoes, onions, and ginger, wrapped in foil or banana leaves, and grilled over hot coals.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 1 large whole fish (e.g., Tilapia, Bangus, or Pompano), cleaned and scaled<br/>
        &#8226; 2 large tomatoes, chopped<br/>
        &#8226; 1 large onion, chopped<br/>
        &#8226; 1 thumb ginger, chopped or julienned<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup soy sauce or patis (fish sauce)<br/>
        &#8226; 2 tablespoons calamansi juice (or lemon juice)<br/>
        &#8226; Salt and pepper to taste<br/>
        &#8226; Banana leaves (wilted over flame) or Aluminum foil<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Prepare Stuffing:</b> In a bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, onion, and ginger. Season with a little salt and pepper.
        2.  <b>Prepare Fish:</b> Pat the fish dry. Rub the inside and outside of the fish with salt, pepper, soy sauce, and calamansi juice.<br/>
        3.  <b>Stuff Fish:</b> Generously stuff the fish cavity with the tomato-onion-ginger mixture.<br/>
        4.  <b>Wrap Fish:</b> Lay the fish on a large piece of banana leaf (or aluminum foil). Wrap it tightly, folding the edges to seal the package.<br/>
        5.  <b>Grill:</b> Preheat a charcoal grill (preferred) or an oven broiler.<br/>
        6.  Place the wrapped fish on the grill. Cook for 15-20 minutes per side, depending on the size and thickness of the fish. The banana leaf will be charred, which adds a smoky aroma.<br/>
        7.  <b>Check for Doneness:</b> Carefully unwrap (watch for steam) and check if the fish flakes easily with a fork.
        8.  <b>Serve:</b> Serve hot with steamed rice and a dipping sauce (toyo, calamansi, and sili).

        <![CDATA[
        Roasted Duck, Filipino style, often involves a flavorful soy sauce and citrus marinade, resulting in a crispy skin and succulent, flavorful meat. It\'s a festive dish perfect for special occasions.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 1 whole duck (about 4-5 lbs), cleaned and dried thoroughly<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup soy sauce<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup calamansi juice (or orange juice)<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup honey or brown sugar<br/>
        &#8226; 1 head garlic, crushed<br/>
        &#8226; 1 tablespoon ginger, grated<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon black pepper<br/>
        &#8226; 1 star anise (optional)<br/>
        &#8226; 2 stalks lemongrass, pounded (for stuffing)<br/>
        &#8226; 1 onion, quartered (for stuffing)<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Prepare Duck:</b> Pat the duck thoroughly dry with paper towels, inside and out. This is crucial for crispy skin.<br/>
        2.  <b>Make Marinade:</b> In a bowl, combine soy sauce, calamansi juice, honey/sugar, crushed garlic, ginger, pepper, and star anise.<br/>
        3.  <b>Marinate:</b> Rub the marinade all over the duck, inside and out. Stuff the cavity with the lemongrass and onion.<br/>
        4.  <b>Refrigerate (Key Step):</b> Place the duck on a rack over a tray and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight. This dries out the skin.<br/>
        5.  <b>Preheat Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).<br/>
        6.  <b>Roast:</b> Place the duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan (this allows fat to drip away). Roast for 1.5 to 2 hours. The time will vary based on the size of the duck.<br/>
        7.  <b>Baste:</b> You can baste the duck with its own drippings or the remaining marinade every 30 minutes.<br/>
        8.  <b>Check Doneness:</b> The duck is cooked when the juices run clear when pierced, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F (74°C).<br/>
        9.  <b>Crisp Skin:</b> If the skin is not crispy enough, you can increase the oven temperature to 400°F (200°C) for the last 10-15 minutes, watching it closely so it doesn\'t burn.<br/>
        10. <b>Rest:</b> Let the duck rest for 15 minutes before carving. This helps the juices redistribute.

        <![CDATA[
        Kinulob na Itik is a traditional Filipino dish, particularly from Rizal province. It involves slow-cooking a whole duck ("itik") in a clay pot, "kulob" style (covered), with various herbs and seasonings, resulting in incredibly tender and flavorful meat.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 1 whole duck (about 4-5 lbs), cleaned<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup soy sauce<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup vinegar<br/>
        &#8226; 1 head garlic, crushed<br/>
        &#8226; 1 large onion, quartered<br/>
        &#8226; 2 stalks lemongrass, pounded<br/>
        &#8226; 3 bay leaves<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon whole peppercorns<br/>
        &#8226; 2 cups water or coconut milk<br/>
        &#8226; Salt to taste<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Marinate:</b> Rub the duck inside and out with soy sauce. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.<br/>
        2.  <b>Stuff:</b> Stuff the duck cavity with the lemongrass, half the garlic, and half the onion.<br/>
        3.  <b>Arrange in Pot:</b> Place the stuffed duck in a large, heavy-bottomed pot (traditionally a clay pot or palayok).<br/>
        4.  <b>Add Aromatics:</b> Add the remaining garlic, onion, bay leaves, and peppercorns around the duck.<br/>
        5.  <b>Simmer:</b> Pour in the vinegar and water (or coconut milk). Bring to a boil without stirring.<br/>
        6.  <b>Slow-Cook:</b> Once boiling, lower the heat, cover the pot tightly (this is the "kinulob" step), and let it simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the duck is very tender.<br/>
        7.  <b>Finish:</b> Check for tenderness. If the liquid hasn\'t reduced, you can remove the lid for the last 15 minutes to thicken the sauce. Season with salt if needed.
        8.  <b>Serve:</b> Carve the duck and serve it with its own rich sauce and steamed rice.

        <![CDATA[
        Duck Kaldereta (Calderetang Pato) is a rich, spicy, and savory Filipino stew. It takes the classic beef or goat kaldereta recipe and applies it to duck, which has a strong, delicious flavor that pairs perfectly with the spicy tomato-liver sauce.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 1 whole duck (about 4-5 lbs), cut into serving pieces<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup soy sauce<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 cup calamansi juice (or vinegar)<br/>
        &#8226; 2 tablespoons cooking oil<br/>
        &#8226; 1 large onion, chopped<br/>
        &#8226; 5 cloves garlic, minced<br/>
        &#8226; 1 large can (15 oz) tomato sauce<br/>
        &#8226; 2 cups beef or chicken broth<br/>
        &#8226; 1 small can (85g) liver spread (or 1/2 cup mashed chicken liver)<br/>
        &#8226; 1-3 red chilies (siling labuyo), chopped (to taste)<br/>
        &#8226; 2 bay leaves<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon black pepper<br/>
        &#8226; 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks<br/>
        &#8226; 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into chunks<br/>
        &#8226; 1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup green olives (optional)<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 cup grated cheese (optional, for finishing)<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Marinate the Duck:</b> In a large bowl, combine the duck pieces, soy sauce, and calamansi juice. Marinate for at least 30 minutes.<br/>
        2.  <b>Sear the Duck:</b> Remove duck from marinade (reserve marinade). Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the duck pieces in batches until browned on all sides. Remove duck and set aside.<br/>
        3.  <b>Saut&#233;:</b> In the same pot, reduce heat to medium. Saut&#233; the garlic and onion until soft and fragrant.<br/>
        4.  <b>Build the Sauce:</b> Add the tomato sauce, reserved marinade, beef broth, bay leaves, and black pepper. Bring to a boil.<br/>
        5.  <b>Simmer the Duck:</b> Return the seared duck pieces to the pot. Lower the heat, cover, and let it simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the duck is very tender (duck takes longer to cook than chicken).<br/>
        6.  <b>Add Vegetables:</b> Add the potatoes and carrots. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes more, or until the vegetables are tender.<br/>
        7.  <b>Thicken and Enrich:</b> Stir in the liver spread and the chopped chilies (siling labuyo). This will thicken the sauce and add richness/heat. Cook for 5 minutes.<br/>
        8.  <b>Finish:</b> Add the red bell pepper and green olives. Simmer for another 3-5 minutes, until the bell pepper is tender-crisp.<br/>
        9.  <b>(Optional) Add Cheese:</b> Just before serving, stir in the grated cheese until it melts into the sauce.<br/>
        10. <b>Season:</b> Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.<br/>
        11. <b>Serve:</b> Serve hot with plenty of steamed rice.

        Pinakbet (or Pakbet) is a popular Filipino vegetable stew. It features a variety of mixed vegetables, steamed in a savory, umami-rich sauce typically made from fermented shrimp paste (bagoong alamang). It\'s often cooked with pork, shrimp, or fried pork belly (lechon kawali).

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 lb pork belly (liempo), cut into small cubes<br/>
        &#8226; 1 tablespoon cooking oil<br/>
        &#8226; 2 cloves garlic, minced<br/>
        &#8226; 1 small onion, chopped<br/>
        &#8226; 2 medium tomatoes, chopped<br/>
        &#8226; 2-3 tablespoons bagoong alamang (fermented shrimp paste)<br/>
        &#8226; 1 cup water or rice washing<br/>
        &#8226; 1 medium ampalaya (bitter melon), cored and sliced<br/>
        &#8226; 1 medium talong (eggplant), sliced<br/>
        &#8226; 1 cup sitaw (long beans), cut into 2-inch pieces<br/>
        &#8226; 1 cup kalabasa (squash or pumpkin), cubed<br/>
        &#8226; 10-12 pieces okra, ends trimmed<br/>
        &#8226; Salt and pepper to taste<br/>
        &#8226; Optional: Fried pork belly (lechon kawali) or crushed chicharon, for topping<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Cook the Pork (if using):</b> In a large pot or wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork belly cubes and fry until lightly browned and crispy (about 5-7 minutes).<br/>
        2.  <b>Saut&#233;:</b> Add the garlic, onion, and tomatoes. Cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and the tomatoes have released their juices (about 3-4 minutes).<br/>
        3.  <b>Add Bagoong:</b> Add the bagoong (shrimp paste) to the pot. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes until it becomes fragrant.<br/>
        4.  <b>Add Liquid:</b> Pour in the water or rice washing and bring the mixture to a boil. Let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.<br/>
        5.  <b>Layer the Vegetables:</b> Add the vegetables starting with the ones that take longest to cook. Add the kalabasa (squash) first and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes.<br/>
        6.  Next, add the sitaw (long beans), ampalaya (bitter melon), talong (eggplant), and okra.
        7.  <b>Cook the Stew:</b> Lower the heat, cover the pot, and let the stew simmer. **Do not stir the Pinakbet** (stirring is said to make the bitter melon more bitter). Instead, gently shake the pot occasionally to mix.<br/>
        8.  Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until all vegetables are "al dente" (cooked through but still firm and crisp). Do not overcook them.<br/>
        9.  <b>Season:</b> Taste the stew. Add salt and pepper as needed. (Be careful with salt, as the bagoong is already very salty).<br/>
        10. <b>Serve:</b> Transfer to a serving dish. Top with fried pork belly (lechon kawali) or chicharon (pork rinds) just before serving for added crunch.

        <![CDATA[
        Tortang Talong (Filipino Eggplant Omelet) is a classic Filipino breakfast or lunch dish. It\'s made by first roasting or broiling eggplants until the skin is charred and the flesh is soft, then peeling the skin, dipping the eggplant in beaten eggs, and frying it into a delicious omelet.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 2 large Chinese or Filipino eggplants<br/>
        &#8226; 2-3 large eggs<br/>
        &#8226; 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)<br/>
        &#8226; 1/4 teaspoon black pepper (to taste)<br/>
        &#8226; 3 tablespoons cooking oil (for frying)<br/>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Roast the Eggplant:</b> Pierce the eggplants a few times with a fork. Roast them directly over a gas stove flame, on a grill, or under the oven broiler, turning frequently until the skin is completely charred and blackened, and the flesh is very soft (about 10-15 minutes). <br/>
        2.  <b>Steam and Cool:</b> Immediately place the hot, charred eggplants in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let them steam in their own heat for about 10 minutes. This makes peeling much easier.<br/>
        3.  <b>Peel and Prepare:</b> Once cool enough to handle, peel off all the charred skin, leaving the stem intact (this acts as a "handle"). Gently rinse to remove any stray bits of skin.<br/>
        4.  Place the peeled eggplant on a cutting board or plate. Using a fork, gently press down and flatten the eggplant, spreading the flesh out like a fan. Be careful to keep the stem attached.<br/>
        5.  <b>Prepare the Egg Mixture:</b> In a shallow dish or plate with a rim, beat the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. (If adding ground meat or green onions, mix them into the beaten eggs now).<br/>
        6.  <b>Coat the Eggplant:</b> Carefully place one flattened eggplant onto the beaten egg mixture. Spoon some of the egg (and meat, if using) over the top of the eggplant, ensuring it is well-coated.
        7.  <b>Fry the Omelet:</b> Heat the cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat.
        8.  Gently slide the egg-coated eggplant into the hot pan. (You can lift it by the stem). Pour a little extra egg mixture on top if needed.<br/>
        9.  Fry for 3-4 minutes on the first side, until the egg is set and golden brown.
        10. <b>Flip and Finish:</b> Carefully flip the omelet over (you can use two spatulas). Fry for another 2-3 minutes on the other side until fully cooked and golden brown.
        11. <b>Serve:</b> Drain on paper towels and serve hot, traditionally with banana ketchup or a soy sauce-vinegar dipping sauce.

        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Prepare the Caramel:</b> In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the water over medium-low heat. Once dissolved, stop stirring. Let it cook until the sugar turns into a golden amber-colored syrup. <br/>
        2.  Immediately pour the hot caramel into your desired mold (a round tin or "llanera"). Quickly tilt the mold to coat the entire bottom surface. Set aside and let the caramel harden completely.<br/>
        3.  <b>Prepare the Custard:</b> In a large mixing bowl, gently beat the 10 egg yolks with a whisk. (Do not over-beat or make it frothy).<br/>
        4.  Slowly add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. Stir in one direction until just combined. Do not whip.<br/>
        5.  <b>Strain the Mixture:</b> Use a fine-mesh sieve (or cheesecloth) to strain the custard mixture into a separate bowl. This step is crucial for a smooth, lump-free flan. Strain it 2-3 times if necessary.<br/>
        6.  <b>Fill the Molds:</b> Gently pour the strained custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the molds.<br/>
        7.  <b>Steam:</b> Cover the molds tightly with aluminum foil. Arrange them in a steamer and steam over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes. (You can also use a water bath/bain-marie in an oven at 350°F / 175°C for 45-60 mins).<br/>
        8.  The flan is cooked when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, or when the center is firm to the touch. Do not overcook, as it can become porous.<br/>
        9.  <b>Chill:</b> Remove from the steamer, let cool to room temperature, and then chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. Chilling is essential for the flan to set properly.<br/>
        10. <b>Serve:</b> To serve, run a thin knife around the edges of the mold to loosen the flan. Place a serving platter on top of the mold and quickly flip it over. The caramel syrup will drizzle over the custard.

        Buko Pandan is a classic Filipino cold dessert made with young coconut strips, pandan-infused gelatin, and a rich, sweet cream mixture. It\'s known for its vibrant green color, refreshing taste, and creamy texture.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <br/>
        &#8226; 2 cups young coconut, shredded<br/>
        &#8226; 1 pack (25g) green gelatin powder, preferably pandan-flavored<br/>
        &#8226; 6 cups water or buko juice if available<br/>
        &#8226; 3/4 cup sugar (for gelatin)<br/>
        &#8226; 1 teaspoon pandan extract or several fresh pandan leaves<br/>
        &#8226; 1 can (300ml) sweetened condensed milk<br/>
        &#8226; 1 can (370ml) all-purpose cream or table cream<br/>

        <b>Instructions:</b>
        <br/>
        1.  <b>Prepare the Pandan Gelatin:</b> In a pot, dissolve the gelatin powder and sugar in the water (or buko juice). Add the pandan extract. (If using fresh leaves, boil them in the water first, then discard the leaves before adding gelatin).<br/>
        2.  Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring constantly. Once boiling, pour it into a rectangular pan or mold.<br/>
        3.  Let it cool and set completely in the refrigerator (about 1-2 hours).<br/>

        5.  <b>Mix the Cream:</b> In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose cream and the sweetened condensed milk. Stir until well-blended.<br/>
        6.  <b>Combine:</b> Add the gelatin cubes, the shredded young coconut, cooked sago, and nata de coco (if using) to the cream mixture. Gently fold everything together until all ingredients are coated in the sweet cream.<br/>
        7.  <b>Chill:</b> Cover the bowl and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. Buko Pandan is best served very cold.<br/>
        8.  <b>Serve:</b> To serve, scoop into individual bowls or glasses and top with a sprinkle of pinipig for a nice crunch.<br/>
